# Data_acquisition_system
Data aquisition system using LPC2129.
Data acquisition is the process of sampling signals that measure real-world physical conditions and converting the resulting samples into digital numeric values that can be manipulated by a computer.
The data acquisition system plays an important role in any monitoring system and is used to collect data from different sensors. Then, this data is digitalized for storage and the DAS sends data to the control center for processing and presentation.
